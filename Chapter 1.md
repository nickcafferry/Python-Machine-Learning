## Chapter 1. Giving Computers the Ability to Learn from Data

The abundance of data means that we can expand our knowledge by using the self-learning algorithms in the field of machine learning, without doing experiment.

The following topics will be discussed in this chapter:

* The general concepts of machine learning.
* The three types of learning and basic terminology.
* The building blocks of successfully designing machine learning systems.
* Installing and setting up Python for data analysis and machine learning.

# Building intelligent machines to transform data into knowledge

Instead of manually deriving rules and building models from analyzing large amounts of data, machine learning provides a more efficient alternative for capturing the knowledge in data to gradually improve the performance of predictive models, and make data-driven decisions. 

# The three different types of machine learning

* Supervised learning;
* Unsupervised learning;
* Reinforcement learning.

# Making predictions about the future with supervised learning

Supervised learning is to learn a model from labeled training data that allows us to make predictions about unseen or future data. The term supervised refers to a set of samples where the desired output signals (labels) are already known.

There are two categories about supervised learning:
* A supervised learning task with discrete class labels is also called a classification task.
* A supervised learning task with continuous value of the outcome signals is called regression.

# Regression for predicting continuous outcomes
* Classification: Assign categorical, unordered labels to instances;
* Regression analysis: Predict continuous outcomes.

# Solving interactive problems with reinforcement learning

Another type of machine learning is reinforcement learning. The goal is to develop a system (agent) that improves its performance based on interactions with the environment.

A popular example of reinforcement learning is a chess engine.

## Discovering hidden structures with unsupervised learning

In supervised learning. we know the right answer beforehand. In unsupervised learning, though, we are dealing with data of unknown structure. We are going to extract meaningful information without the guidance of a known outcome variable or reward function.
