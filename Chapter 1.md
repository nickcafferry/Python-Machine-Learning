## Chapter 1. Giving Computers the Ability to Learn from Data

The abundance of data means that we can expand our knowledge by using the self-learning algorithms in the field of machine learning, without doing experiment.

The following topics will be discussed in this chapter:

* The general concepts of machine learning.
* The three types of learning and basic terminology.
* The building blocks of successfully designing machine learning systems.
* Installing and setting up Python for data analysis and machine learning.

# Building intelligent machines to transform data into knowledge

Instead of manually deriving rules and building models from analyzing large amounts of data, machine learning provides a more efficient alternative for capturing the knowledge in data to gradually improve the performance of predictive models, and make data-driven decisions. 

# The three different types of machine learning

* Supervised learning;
* Unsupervised learning;
* Reinforcement learning.
